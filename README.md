> For those who missed out on the ”clear craze” of the mid-1990s, we proudly present a revival of the fruity drink that ruled the decade — this is ZIMA, revitalised and now available in six invigorating flavours. From Tropical Clementine Pineapple to the zesty White Strawberry Lemonade, ZIMA can be certain to soothe even the pickiest of palates.
